# Pinecone take-home project

Kyler Mintah

## Assignment

Build a single page with this content:

https://gkogan.notion.site/gkogan/The-OP-Stack-aafcab0005e3445a8ad8491aac80446c

Live Site:

https://63d2015e42a9be4ec54a90fa--resilient-tanuki-4f9872.netlify.app/

## Assumptions and Notes

- The site is built with React & Bootstrap. Deployed on Netlify. Some changes would be required to be [Jamstack approved](https://www.datocms.com/blog/best-jamstack-react-frameworks).
- The diagram in the "How does the OP Stack work?" section cycles through logos of various data warehouses and client applications. Some architectural assumptions are being made here regarding compatibility. 
- Ran out of time on the tweet carousel but idea would be to create a tweet feed. 
- With some additional work, I would improve the carousel, have it pull tweets from a stream and perhaps move on scroll to allow users to browse various tweets.
- Site should display fine for some mobile devices but needs further optmizations. Missing accessibility elements need to be added as well (aria-controls etc.)
